# The Course
"Fullstack Open" is a free course provided by University of Helsinki to everyone, accessible online. It teaches fullstack web developement with JavaScript, as well as general programming practices.

# Segments
The course is divided into 14 parts:
<h4>Part 0 - Fundamentals of Web apps</h4>
<p>The user is familiarized with the practicalities of taking the course and given an overview of the basics of web development, and also talks about the advances in web application development during the last few decades.</p>
<h4>Part 1 - Introduction to React</h4>
<p>The user is familiarized with the React library, which is used for the frontend in the course. This parts also looks at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.</p>
<h4>Part 2 - Communicating with server</h4>
<p>This part takes a look at how to render data collections, how users can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Then the focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server.</p>
<h4>Part 3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express</h4>
<p>In this part, the focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. It implements a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of the part, the application is deployed to the internet.</p>
<h4>Part 4 - Testing Express servers, user administration</h4>
<p>In this part, the course continues to work on the backend. The first major theme is writing unit and integration tests for the backend. After testing, it takes a look at implementing user authentication and authorization.</p>
<h4>Part 5 - Testing React apps</h4>
<p>In this part the course returns to the frontend, first looking at different possibilities for testing the React code. What is also implement is token based authentication which will enable users to log in to the application.</p>
<h4>Part 6 - State management with Redux</h4>
<p>So far, the application's state and state logic was located directly inside React components. Part 6 teaches that when applications grow larger, state management should be moved outside React components. The Redux library is introduced, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React applications.</p>
<h4>Part 7 - React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack</h4>
<p>The seventh part of the course touches on several different themes. First, it familiarizes with React router. React router helps divide the application into different views that are shown based on the URL in the browser's address bar. It also takes a look at a few more ways to add CSS styles to React applications. During the entire course, create-react-app is used to generate the body of the applications. This pat takes a look under the hood: how Webpack works and how one can use it to configure the application. It also takes a look at hook functions and how to define a custom hook.</p>
<h4>Part 8 - GraphQL</h4>
<p>This part of the course is about GraphQL, Facebook's alternative to REST for communication between browser and server.</p>
<h4>Part 9 - TypeScript</h4>
<p>This part is all about TypeScript: an open-source typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that compiles to plain JavaScript. In this part, the course implements tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem with linters predefined and an existing codebase writing TypeScript.</p>
<h4>Part 10 - React Native</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>Part 11 - CI/CD</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>Part 12 - Containers</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>Part 13 - Using relational databases</h4>
<p></p>
